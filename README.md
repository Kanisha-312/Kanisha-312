# Hi there 👋 I'm Kanisha Raja!

🎓 **AI Engineer | MS in Artificial Intelligence**  

I’m a recent graduate from the University at Buffalo with a strong focus on applied AI and machine learning systems.

I enjoy building end-to-end ML systems spanning data pipelines, modeling, evaluation, uncertainty analysis, and reproducible experimentation.

I’m interested in building AI systems that are not just accurate — but reliable, interpretable, and human-aware.

📍 Buffalo, NY 

🔍 Open to **AI Engineer / ML Engineer / Applied ML roles — Available Immediately**
